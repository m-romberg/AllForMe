      <p>I'm a full-stack developer in Los Angeles, California with a passion for contributing to revolutionary ideas and building meaningful projects. After completing two degrees at UCLA and a
        full stack web development program, I am currently seeking work as a software engineer.
        Throughout my time as a researcher in both chemistry and history, I constantly leveraged the power of code to discover, clean, and convey never-before-seen information that led to tangible
        impacts. Previously, I was an atmospheric chemist at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, supporting the development of a chemical reanalysis model to be used by public health officials regarding
        air quality standards. Additionally, I had a project commissioned with the Los Angeles Public Library's Special Collections to build a digital database that improved accessibility and
        increased user traffick. Programming enabled me to engage in two vastly different sectors and effective to make change in both.
        Let's do something incredible together, one line at a time.
